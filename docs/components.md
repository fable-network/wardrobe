All components should follow the next rules:

* Use sizes, colors, etc. from the `theme` object.
* Pass not used props to the underlying element (use cases: data-attributes, form elements' attributes, additional styling).
* Describe component states and behaviour in this styleguide.
* Built with `styled-components`.
* Support styling with a theme.
